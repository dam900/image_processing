# image_processing
After the course Digital signals and images i wanted to learn more about image processing.

I wanted to make small console program to present the effect of numerous CV algorithms.
In order to learn about both implementation of the algorithms and their usage with openCV
I made ```ImageProcessor``` class for my own implementation and ```VideoProcessor``` for openCV.

Currently there are only algorithms for:
* converting RGB to Grey Scale
* detecting horizontal and vertical edges

# Usage:
